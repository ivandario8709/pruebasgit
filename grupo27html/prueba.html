    <p>For over 25 years we have had one simple mission: to inspire as many of you as possible to travel by bike. We believe there&#39;s no better way to really experience a place, its people and its culture. More than ever before, we know that to travel is a privilege and we can&#39;t wait to bring you more adventures on the bike again in 2021. Before then, you can read our dedicated&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.skedaddle.com/blog/coronavirus-update/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">COVID-19 page</span></a></u>, which includes information about how we have adapted our cycle tours.&nbsp;</p>
